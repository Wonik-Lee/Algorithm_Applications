# A La Russe Algorithm

This repository contains a C implementation of the **A La Russe multiplication algorithm**, also known as **Russian peasant multiplication**.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Overview

- The algorithm multiplies two integers using:
  - Repeated halving of one operand
  - Doubling of the other operand
  - Summing only the doubled values when the halved number is **odd**
- This method mimics binary multiplication using additions and shifts.
